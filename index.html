    <h1>CSS Basics</h1>

    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p><b>CSS</b> stands for <b>Cascading StyleSheets</b> and is used to modify the appearance of a web page, including fonts used, text size, colors, spacing and layout. It is a <strong>distinct language from HTML</strong> – which means it’s written in a different style and has different rules – yet has a close relationship with HTML because it affects and changes HTML elements.</p>

    <p>That pretty much sums up the <b>stylesheet</b> part of the name – it’s a file that outlines the stylistic rules for another document – but what about <strong>cascading</strong>? That is a pretty poetic and evocative word for a computer language, no? The short answer is this: the cascade refers to the order and importance of your style rules. Once you’ve practiced some basic CSS, we’ll revisit the cascade and you’ll explore some examples of why it’s important.</p>

    <h2>Writing CSS</h2>
    <p>The element you are affecting is called a <b>selector</b> and the code you write to affect the selector are known as <b>declarations</b>. A declaration is made up of two parts: the area of your affect is a <b>CSS property</b> and the way you want it to change is the <b>value</b>. Combined, all of these things make a CSS ruleset.</p>

    <p>In this example, the <code>p</code> element is the selector and the declarations change the color of the text inside the <code>p</code> element to be 18 pixels in size and purple in color.</p>
